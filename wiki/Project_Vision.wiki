#summary Project Vision; Initial Agenda; Action Plan;
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

=Project Vision=
  # Edge Detection
  # Texture generation and mapping
  # Depth Detection

==Constraints==
  * Use Gray Scale Images
  * Tactile feedback—bumps and vibrations
  * Predefined inputs images/graphics
  * Fixed height of camera and known distance to background
  * Known color to texture mapping – brown-wood, blue-water, lightbrown-sand, etc
  * Known geometry of objects

==Future==
To make this more generic: 
  # Use Color images
  # Block based frequency analysis classification: classify images as rough, smooth, etc
    
=Plan of Action=

==Team A==

  * Understanding Theory 
    * Edge detection –complete
    * Depth detection --algorithm only
  * Vibration Signals to Texture Mapping
  * Matlab Programming
    * Basic programming
    * Image handling 
    * Graphics (optional)
  * High level Demo 
    * Edge Detection
    * Depth Detection
    * Texture Mapping

==Team B==
  * Finding an API
    * Matlab
    * simulink or 
    * VC haptic plugins
  * Selecting an API
    * CHAI3D
    * H3D
    * Quick Haptics
    * Open Haptics
  * Choosing a Development environment 
    * Matlab preferred
    * VC
    * simulink 
  * Feasibility check of API - Integrating with Development Environment
  * Demo on Falcon
    * Ready Made
    * Texture rendering
    * Force rendering
