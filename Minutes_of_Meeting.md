# SC's feedback (mail) #
He really liked the idea and suggested improvements in the following when I asked him how to take this project to a substantiate level. Of course he was fascinating about Video Haptics too! :)

  1. "Zoom" in onto an local area and let the user feel so. Let this be dynamic.
  1. Better and more "Immersive" Haptic Rendering / Force Feedback
  1. Play with simpler images: http://marathon.csee.usf.edu/range/DataBase.html  for USF range image database
  1. Better / Dynamic Orientation of the Falcon with Matlab's Visual View.
  1. Low Priority: Try CHAI 3D or other APIs incase it provieds a better feedback/interface.

BTW,
  * Husain already has made a partial implementation of #1. I don't have it yet, but plan to integrate it soon into my code.
  * Nikhil and I were working on #2 and have had some success.

# 8 October #
Our project has come to an end. Around 70% of the work is done. Keeping in mind **Diwali vacation**, **integration effort** and the **unsolved problems** we should try to wind up the project soon and **keep spare time** for workarounds.

Here you can keep track of **your tasks** and see who is interested in working with you next, you might want to keep him/her posted. Feel free to update this page as you see fit.

**Agenda:**
Tasks up ahead till Sunday, 11th October

**Next**
  * Meet: Sunday Evening.
  * Unsolved problems
    * Image Texture Classification
    * Haptic Texture Rendering
  * Integration for Release-1.0


## Manav ##
  * Finish GUI till Sunday, latest by Monday. GUI Features:
    * Calls for all functionalities
    * {depth detect, depth rendering, texture map, texture rendering}
    * Generate corresponding graphs
    * Find out how to integrate embedded models with GUI
    * Find out how to interact with an existing graph. Feel the posterior of the contour etc.

Next Steps:
  * Integrate project for Milestone-Release-1.0

## Neelam ##
  * Surface Force Rendering; Given any gray scale image; Saturday
Next Steps:
Haptic Texture Mapping:
  * Set of 5-10 textures and their force function(matrix)

## Husain ##
  * output of different input image depths by tomorrow.
  * Understanding of Depth Detection till Saturday
  * Implementation of Depth Detection on Matlab Code till Sunday. Latest by Monday.

## Jhelum ##
  * Helping Husain in understanding depth detection model (till Saturday)
    * Understanding epipolor geometry
    * Normalized cross correlation (till EOD Friday)
    * Fundamental Matrix (till Saturday)

Next Steps:
  * Wants to read Fourier applications in image processing. Image Texture classification, with KL
  * Implementation: How to generate the force? Start on Monday. with Manav

## KL Srinivas ##
  * (deferred due to low priority) ~~Understanding of Texture segmentation. Version 3.~~
  * Image Texture Classification. Till Sunday.

Next Steps:
  * Force Rendering of Haptic Textures. Sand, Water, Grass.
